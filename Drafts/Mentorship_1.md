# Accepted in F# Software Foundation’s Mentorship Program

It is my pleasure to share that I got selected in F# Software Foundation’s Mentorship Program. 
My mentor is Oleg. As per the discussion we decided to meet one hour in every weekend using Skype. For the first 30 minutes will be used to clear my doubts regarding F# and next 30 minutes will be used to do solving challenges in HackerRank via pair programming. I am totally excited about this! Hope I will utilize this opportunity fully.
