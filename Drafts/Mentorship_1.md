# Accepted in F# Software Foundation’s Mentorship Program

It is my pleasure to share that I got selected in F# Software Foundation’s Mentorship Program. 
My mentor is Oleg. As per the discussion we decided to meet one hour in every weekend using Skype. For the first 30 minutes will be used to clear my doubts regarding F# and next 30 minutes will be used to do solving challenges in HackerRank via pair programming. I am totally excited about this! Hope I will utilize this opportunity fully.

F# Software Foundation Mentoring Program
Week 1: 10-Sep-2017
My setup:
Mac OS X, VS Code, Ionide.  I just started off with f# tour in 
Summary:
We started off with an introduction 

Next week plan:
As per we discussed in today's meeting, I will be following the F# for fun and profit web site. For this week I will be practicing more questions from the HackerRank.

Here are the few questions related to F#.
Type representation is little confusing, like tuple is (a, b) but in type highlighter will show it as a * b , Is there a good place look for more details to understand about this type representation?
Why do we need to explicitly specify a function is recursive using rec?
Won't the immutability cause to use more memory, since every time we create a new change we are creating a new object/value?
I read some where using mutable variable is not a functional way, in F# do we always try or prefer to not use mutable variables?
Why arrays are mutable while lists are not?
