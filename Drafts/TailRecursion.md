# Tail Recursion in F#
As I was learning more about functional programming with F#, Iâ€™ve been looking at recursive programming techniques and fascinated about tail recursion. As part of my experiments I put together a number of F# examples of both recursion as well as tail recursion. As well as the comparison of performance and memory usage. Used online compiler [.NET Fiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/) for running and comparing performance.

These are the examples I tried:
- Sum
- Product
- Max
- Fibonacci
- Factorial
I am not planning to write more about tail recursion and compiler optimization in this post, may some other time when I have more clear understanding. 

### Sum
Finding sum of all element in a list by both recursion and tail recursion.
### Product
### Max
### Fibonacci
### Factorial
