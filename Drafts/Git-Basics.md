## Introduction to Git
[Git](https://git-scm.com/), a version control created by [Linus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), creator of Linux. It was created for managing contributions to linux code base.
```csharp
public static void AreEqual(object expected,object actual)  
```
For example, I wrote code like :
```csharp
Assert.AreEqual("ActualString1", CretedString1);  
Assert.AreEqual("ActualString2", CretedString2);  
Assert.AreEqual("ActualString3", CretedString3);  
```
The parameter is reversed order, it's not right and For sure I will get a review comment to change this. To swap this parameter we can use find and replace with regular expression.
{% blockquote %}
Note : Regular Expression in Visual Studio is bit different.
{% endblockquote %}

##### Add this as Search Term
```csharp
\((".*"),([^\)]*)  
```
##### Add this as Replace Term
```csharp
($2, $1  
```

##### How its works
![alt text](/2017/08/19/vs-regex/RegEx.png "How RegEx works.")
For information about regular expressions that are used in replacement patterns, see [Substitutions in Regular Expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/substitutions-in-regular-expressions). To use a numbered capture group, the syntax is $2 to specify the numbered group and (x) to specify the group in question. 
For example, the grouped regular expression (\d)([a-z]) finds four matches in the following string: 1a 2b 3c 4d. 
The replacement string z$1 converts that string to z1 z2 z3 z4.

- Be careful to select code part you want to swap parameter.Dont apply for whole Document or Solution, It might do some harmfull effects.
- You can tweak the RegX for other use cases where parameter pattern is different.
- There exist some shortcuts to reorder the parameter in VS but ii didn't work for me and even if it work, We need to select each AreEqual method and apply those shortcut.
