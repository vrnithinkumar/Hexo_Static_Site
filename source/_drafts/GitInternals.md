# Learning Git Internals
After learning the basics of git, I want to know more about the internals of git and how it works. So I started reading the book [Git Internals](https://github.com/pluralsight/git-internals-pdf/releases/download/v2.0/peepcode-git.pdf) by **Scott Chacon**. This post is all the notes from this book as well as my outside readings.
## History
Git project started by **Linus Torvaldes** for source code management for Linux. He was not impressed by all the existing source control systems, so he started to create a new distributed source code management system. In current state, git is the [most commonly used version control system](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#work-version-control). Not just Linux many other free and open source software adopted git as default version control system.
