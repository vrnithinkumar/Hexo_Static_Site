I am happy to announce that my proposal for GSoC 2020 - Find null smart pointer dereferences with the LLVM-Clang Static Analyzer got accepted. This summer I will be working on adding the feature to the static analyser to find null smart pointer dereferences. 

I am very much excited and terrified. Hopefully with help from my mentors **Artem Dergachev**, **Gabor Horwath**, and **Valeriy Savchenkod**, I will be able to finish the project with.

I will try to blog my progress and anything exciting I find in my journey.
