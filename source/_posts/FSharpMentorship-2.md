Summary:
I updated my progress in both sharp for fun and profit and hacker rank, we discussed one of my solution in hacker rank. Oleg suggested to try Fibonacci in different ways.
[Compute the Perimeter of a Polygon](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/lambda-march-compute-the-perimeter-of-a-polygon)
My initial code
```CSharp
//Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
let distance (x1:int,y1:int) (x2:int,y2:int) =
    let xDiff = abs x1-x2
    let yDiff = abs y1-y2
    let sqrSum = (pown xDiff 2)+( pown yDiff 2)
    sqrt (double sqrSum)
    
let getPoint (s:string) =
    let va = 
        s.Split(' ') 
        |> Array.map System.Int32.Parse
    (va.[0], va.[1])

[<EntryPoint>]
let main argv = 
    let t = System.Console.ReadLine()|> int
    let values = 
        Seq.initInfinite(fun _ -> System.Console.ReadLine())
        |> Seq.takeWhile(isNull >> not)
        |> Seq.map getPoint
        |> Seq.toList

    let first, rest  = values.[0], List.tail values
    
    let foldFunc (perimeter, prevPoint) nxtPoint =
        perimeter+(distance prevPoint nxtPoint), nxtPoint

    let (finalPerimeter , last) = List.fold foldFunc (0.0, first) rest
    
    printfn "%f" (finalPerimeter + (distance first last))
    0
```
Cleaned up code
```CSharp
//Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
let distance ((x1:int,y1:int), (x2:int,y2:int)) =
    let xDiff = abs x1-x2
    let yDiff = abs y1-y2
    let sqrSum = (pown xDiff 2)+( pown yDiff 2)
    sqrt (double sqrSum)

let getPoint (s:string) =
    let [| x ; y |] = 
        s.Split(' ') 
        |> Array.map System.Int32.Parse
    x, y

[<EntryPoint>]
let main argv = 
    let testCases = System.Console.ReadLine()|> int
    let mutable firstPoint = (0,0)
    let values = 
        Seq.init testCases (fun i -> System.Console.ReadLine())
        |> Seq.map getPoint
        |> Seq.toList
        
    let lines = Seq.pairwise (values.[0]::(List.rev values))
    
    let perimeter = 
        lines
        |> Seq.map distance 
        |> Seq.sum
    
    printfn "%f" perimeter
    0
```
### New concepts I learned
- **Seq.pairwise**
Seq.pairwise method will take a sequence and returns a sequence of tuple with element in the input sequence and its predecessor.
eg: `Seq.pairwise [1..4]` returns `[(1, 2); (2, 3); (3, 4)]`
- **Seq.init**
Generates a new sequence which, when iterated, will return successive elements by calling the given function, up to the given count. eg :Seq.init count initializer
eg : `Seq.init 4 (fun n -> n * 2)` returns `[0, 2, 4, 6]`

- **yield** **VS** **yield!(yield bang)**
```csharp
let simpleYield = seq { for i in 1..10 do yield i}
//
let simpleYieldBang = seq { for i in 1..10 do yield i; yield!  simpleYield}
//
```


### Here are the few questions we discussed
1. *Is None is same as null of C#?*
Yes. When you convert the F# to C# it is similar to null. It is used to represent a value that may not exist or invalid.

2. *Is there any types for None or Some?*
Yes. It is called Option type a union type of two case `None` and `Some`. eg : `int option` is a option type which wraps a int value. It is used with pattern matching for handling cases like where valid value not exists. [More Details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/options)

3. *Is List.fold is recursive calling or for loop inside implementation?*

4. *Is Seq.unfold similar to lazy list in C#? Is it storing any state internally?*
Internal structure iterator and we a calculating.

5. *Partial application, is the parameter passing always follow from the left to right?*
    let fn a b c = ()
    let fn1 = fn a
    fn1 b c
    fn1 (b c)
    let fn2 a: int -> int = fun b -> 0
    int -> int -> unit
    let fn a b c = ()
    fn1 (fn2 a)

6. *While finding the type by type inference do we actually handle the runtime case?* 
For example : 
    `let x = 2147483647 + 1` No error 
    `let y = 2147483648 ` Shows error FS1147: This number is outside the allowable range for 32-bit signed integers
